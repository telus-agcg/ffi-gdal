## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `.release` class method for many `GDAL` types.

### Changed

- *BREAKING*: All methods with default boolean args are now keyword args.
- *BREAKING*: `required_ruby_version` set to `>= 2.6`
- BREAKING: `OGR::DataSource#copy_data_source` now raises instead of returning
  `nil` on a failure to copy.
- BREAKING: `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value=` now accepts `nil` to allow
  unsetting the NODATA value.
- BREAKING: Many methods were not communicating errors `CPLErr` back to the
  caller; these now raise on `CE_Failure` or `CE_Fatal`:
  - `GDAL::Dataset#add_band`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#build_overviews`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#create_mask_band`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#geo_transform=`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#geo_transform`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#projection=`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#raster_io`
  - `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset_files`
  - `GDAL::Driver#delete_dataset`
  - `GDAL::Driver#rename_dataset`
  - `GDAL::MajorObject#set_metadata_item`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#create_column`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#set_linear_binning`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable.from_color_table`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#category_names=`

  - `GDAL::RasterBand#fill`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#flush_cache`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#offset=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#scale=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#unit_type=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`
- BREAKING:
  `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_utm`'s
  second param is now a keyword arg, `north:` that defaults to `true` (like
  GDAL's default).
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_towgs84`'s
  `z_distance` requires a value internally, but was defaulted to `nil`; changed
  the default value to `0.0.`

### Fixed

- `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value` uses `BigDecimal` for checking the returned
  float value.
- [DEV-12827] Fixed lots of double-free crashes resulting from misuse of
  `FFI::Pointer#autorelease`:
  - `GDAL::CPLErrorHandler#custom_handle`
  - `GDAL::ColorInterpretation.name`
  - `GDAL::ColorTable#clone`
  - `GDAL::ColorTable#initialize`
  - `GDAL::DataType.name`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#gcp_projection`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#projection`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#raster_band`
  - `GDAL::Driver#creation_option_list`
  - `GDAL::Driver#help_topic`

  - `GDAL::Options.pointer`
  - `GDAL::Options.to_hash`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#column_name`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#value_as_string`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#initialize`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#unit_type`
  - `OGR::DataSource#new`
  - `OGR::Driver#name`

  - `OGR::Geometry#type_to_name`
  - `OGR::Geometry.type_to_name`
  - `OGR::GeometryFieldDefinition#name`
  - `OGR::Layer#name`
  - `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRSQLMethods#fid_column`
  - `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRSQLMethods#geometry_column`
  - `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#authority_code`
  - `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#authority_name`
  - `OGR::StyleTool#param_as_string`
  - `OGR::StyleTool#style_string`
- [DEV-12827] Fixed a number of memory leaks where returned strings should be
  released using `FFI::CPL::VSI.VSIFree()`:
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_gml`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_kml`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_geo_json`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_wkt`
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::Importers::ClassMethods#new_from_epsga` was
  incorrectly calling `import_from_epsg` instead of `import_from_epsga`.
- `OGR::SpatialReference.release` fixed to use `OSRRelease()` in order to avoid
  free-after-use.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_utm`'s
  internal call was expecting an `int`, but was getting passed a `bool`.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#towgs84` now
- properly reads data out of the internal C array.

### Removed

- [DEV-361] Move extension methods to ffi-gdal-extensions.
- Removed attach_function to CPLURLGetValue and CPLURLAddKVP as they are not in GDAL 2.

### Fixed

- Ensure `GDAL::RasterBandMixinsIOExtensions#read_blocks_by_block` always yields
  an Array of pixels.

## [1.0.0.beta7] - 2016-09-21

### Added

#### GDAL

- Added wrapper for GDALCreateAndReprojectImage in
  `gdal/dataset_mixins/warp_methods.rb`.
- Added `GDAL::Options.to_hash` to convert a pointer of options to a Ruby Hash.

### Changed

#### GDAL

- (BREAKING CHANGE) Additionally, changed
  `GDAL::DatasetMixins::WarpMethods#reproject_image`'s
  `destination_spatial_reference` named param to `destination_projection` which
  takes a String of WKT for a projection instead of an `OGR::SpatialReference`.
- Return `nil` for missing NODATA values in `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value` and
  `#no_data_value=`.

### Fixed

#### Core

- Fixed specifying an alternate GDAL library using the `GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`.

#### GDAL

- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::IOExtensions#write_xy_narray` no longer duplicates
  data when blocks have a remainder.
- `GDAL::WarpOptions` should properly act as a wrapper for `FFI::GDAL::WarpOptions`.
- `Updated extract methods to be compatible with latest `GDAL::Driver#create_dataset`.
- `GDAL::MajorObject` now gets autoloaded.
- Fix `GDAL::DatasetMixins::AlgorithmMethods` to use the right `FFI` module for
  `#rasterize_geometries` and `#rasterize_layers`.

#### OGR

- [AGDEV-17357] Define constants from C using `const_set` instead of `class_eval`.
- Fixed `OGR::GeometryTypes::Curve#points` (missing local variable).

### Removed

- Removed all `#as_json` and `#to_json` definitions. They were out of date, not
  used, and sometimes confusing (ex `OGR::Geometries#to_json` vs `#to_geo_json`).

## [1.0.0.beta6] - 2016-04-18

### Added

#### GDAL

- Added wrappers for the Grid API. It uses `GDAL::Gridder`, which is the
  programmatic equivalent to the `gdal_grid` command-line utility,
  `GDAL::GridderOptions`, which is an object used to mimic the options you pass
  to `gdal_grid`, and `GDAL::Grid`, which is the simple object that performs the
  gridding.
- Added first wrapper of `gdalwarper.h` methods, found in
  `GDAL::DatasetMixins::WarpMethods`.
- Added `GDAL::GeoTransformMixins::Extensions.new_from_envelope` which lets you
  create a `GDAL::GeoTransform` using the points from an `OGR::Envelope` and the
  destination raster's width and height. It's convenient because it calculates
  the pixel size for you.
- Added `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`. Somehow this went missing from previous
  `RasterBand` wrapping.
- Added `GDAL::InternalHelpers._buffer_from_data_type` to compliment the
  existing `._pointer_from_data_type`. Useful for creating buffer-specific
  pointers from a GDAL data type.
- Added `GDAL::InternalHelpers` methods for creating NArrays based on GDAL
  data types.
- `GDAL::Options` values all have `#to_s` called on them to ensure they're
  Strings before handing them over to GDAL. The GDAL options "hash" requires
  that both keys and values be Strings.
- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::AlgorithmMethods` that use GDALProgressFunc functions
  can now participate in GDALScaledProgress functions.
- Added `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Extensions#pixel_count`.
- Allow `GDAL::Dataset`s to be open in shared mode vs non-shared mode. All
  Datasets now default to use shared mode.
- Added enumerator `RasterAttributeTableMixins::Extensions#each_column` to allow
  nicer iterating over columns.

#### OGR

- Added `OGR::CoordinateTransform#transform_ex`.
- Added `OGR::FeatureExtensions#field()` which gets the field using the
  associated `OGR::FieldDefinition#type`. Makes so you don't always have to
  request the field by its type (`field_as_double`).
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#point_values()` which gets values for all
  of the points in the layer. It also allows you to specify getting field values
  with that, which helps retrieving data for the Grid API. You can also pass it
  a block to filter out points that don't match some criteria defined in the
  block.
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#any_geometries_with_z?` which simply
  checks to see if the layer has any geometries with Z values.
- `GDAL::DataType.by_name` always calls `#to_s` on the param now, letting you
  pass in Symbols.
- Added `OGR::Point#set_point`, `OGR::Point25#set_point`, and
  `OGR::GeometryTypes::Curve#set_point` wrappers for `OGR_G_SetPoint_2D` and
  `OGR_G_SetPoint`.
- Added `OGR::LineString#add_geometry` to allow adding a OGR::Point object to
  the LineString instead of having to pass coordinates in to #add_point.
- Added `OGR::GeometryMixins::Extensions#invalid?` to compliment
  `OGR::Geometry#valid?`.
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#point_geometry`, `#each_point_geometry`,
  and `point_geometries`. Since `#point` implies it returns a Point object, but
  the OGR API's related method returns point values (x, y, z), it seemed like
  it would be useful to have a method that returned a geometry.

### Changed

#### GDAL

- Renamed `GDAL::GridTypes` to `GDAL::GridAlgorithms`. This shouldn't impact
  anyone/thing since it's only relative to the newly added Grid API wrapper.
  There just happened to me some Grid cruft that had been laying around for some
  time.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Extenions#each_by_block` to `#read_by_block`.
  Its functionality was doing reading, yet implied reading or writing; since
  writing by block isn't needed anywhere internally yet, I just renamed this.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterBandMixins#write_array` to `#write_xy_narray`. This
  method's name inferred that it could write any old Array, but that's not the
  case--it only writes 2D NArray data.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#extent` now manually builds an `OGR::Polygon`
  instead of polygonizing the entire dataset and taking the envelope of that.
  Much faster this way.
- Refactored `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Exsentions#projected_points` to return a
  3D NArray (indicating pixel/row position) instead of just a 2D NArray of
  coordinates.
- Allow `GDAL::RasterBand#create_mask_band` to take a single flag or many.
- Allow `GDAL::Driver#create_dataset` and `GDAL::Dataset.open` to take a block,
  yielding the dataset then closing it afterwards.
- `GDAL::RasterBandClassifier` now uses NArray to classify. Can result in quite
  a large performance gain.
- `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable` methods that returned -1 when a value can't be
  returned now return nil instead.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#value_to_*` methods to be named after
  their C functions. Also, renamed `#add_value` to `#set_value` and refactored
  into `RasterAttributeTableMixins::Extensions`.
- Swapped order of params in `GDAL::Driver#rename_dataset` to be (old, new)
  instead of (new, old).
- `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset` now yields a writable Dataset.
- `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset` now properly takes progress block arguments.

#### OGR

- `OGR::DataSource.open` can now take a block, yielding the data source, then
  closing it afterwards.
- Extracted `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#each_feature` from
  `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#features` to provide an Enumerator. This lets
  consumers utilize yielded `OGR::Feature`s as they're retrieved instead of
  after the `features` Array has been built.
  `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#features` now uses this too.

### Fixed

- Cleanup `OGR::Feature`s that were a result of `OGR::Layer#next_feature`.
  According to GDAL docs, these *must* be cleaned up before the layer is.

#### GDAL

- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::AlgorithmMethods#fill_nodata!` was calling the old
  name of the C function.
- `GDAL::EnvironmentMethods#dump_open_datasets` now works.

#### OGR

- `OGR::Field#date=` was casting the passed value to a `Time` object, which in
  doing so was setting the time zone. If a user passes in an object that doesn't
  have the TZ set, the method shouldn't be setting it for them.
- `OGR::Geometry#point_on_surface` now properly returns a geometry object.
- `OGR::CoordinateTransform#transform` never worked. Fixed.
- `OGR::GeometryMixins::Extensions#utm_zone` no longer creates invalid geometry.
- `OGR::Feature#dump_readable` never worked. Fixed.
- `OGR::Geometry#dump_readable` never worked. Fixed.
- Added missing output_layer param to `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRLayerMethodMethods`.
- `FFI::OGR::Core::WKBGeometryType` was using an INT32 instead of UINT32 and
  thus 25D geometry types weren't completely accurate.
- `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#geometry_from_extent` now builds an
  `OGR::Polygon` using the same algorithm that
  `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#extent` uses. One could argue that there was
  also a bug here in that `geometry_from_extent` used to return the convex hull
  of the extent, not the extent itself.

### Removed

- Removed all `ObjectSpace.define_finalizer` calls that "cleaned up" C pointers
  for Ruby-wrapped objects that had not yet been closed/destroyed. This was
  keeping those Ruby objects from getting collected (?) and effectively causing
  lots of unnecessary memory use.

## [1.0.0.beta5] - 2015-06-16

### Added

- Added `GDAL::RasterBand#raster_io` and refactored
  `GDAL::RasterBand#write_array` to use it.

### Changed

- `GDAL::RasterBandClassifier#equal_count_ranges` now returns `nil` if there
  aren't enough points per group/class to return the requested number of
  breaks.
- Simplified NDVI (and related) methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions`.
- NDVI and related methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` now close
  the newly created dataset instead of leaving it open. It's been far too
  easy to forget to close the dataset after creation, leaving seemingly
  incorrect resulting datasets (since GDAL doesn't flush writes until the
  dataset is closed).
- NDVI methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` no longer check for
  NaNs after doing the NDVI calculations, thus speeding up the algorithm.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#remove_negatives_from` now uses an NArray
  mask to remove the negative values instead of looping through each value.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` NDVI methods now default to NODATA of
  `-9999.0`.

## [1.0.0.beta4] - 2015-04-22

Whoa there's lots of changes here... Many are outlined below, but there's really
a ton more.

### Added

- Added `GDAL::RasterClassifier` for classifying raster bands.
- Added some wrapper methods for classes that support capability testing.
- Better library finding on Linux.
- Wrapped most of `GDAL`'s Grid API.
- Wrapped some of `GDAL`'s Warp API.
- `GDAL::Dataset` can now open PostGISRaster datasets.

### Changed

- Full refactor of FFI/C function wrapper. Closer mapping of Ruby functions
  within modules to the C-header files where the functions actually reside.
- Full redesign of the error handling mechanism; ffi-gdal now hooks in to
  GDAL's error handling, thus errors raised from GDAL automagically get handed
  over as Ruby exceptions. (GDAL only; OGR doesn't provide this.) This also
  entailed adding a bunch of new exceptions and renaming some old ones.
- Lots more `OGR` love. Much of this API has now been vetted.

### Fixed

- Fixed some `GDAL::Dataset` extension methods (`extract_ndvi` and friends)
  that weren't properly handling various data types.
- Better handling of large files.
- Fixed regular crashes when dealing with `OGR` Geometries and
  `SpatialReferences`.

## [1.0.0.beta3] - 2014-11-11

### Fixed

- `ogr/exceptions` wasn't being required for `ext/error_symbols.rb`, thus
  any use of an OGR exception was causing a `NameError`.

## [1.0.0.beta2] - 2014-10-23

### Added

- Added more documentation
- Uncommented `attach_function` calls that had been commented out due to
  lack of support in versions I'd tested on.  These get handled now on load.

## [1.0.0.beta1] - 2014-10-23

Lots of changes, so just the highlights here...

### Added

- Added C and Ruby wrapper for most of `OGR`.
- Allow loading, even when C functions aren't defined in the version of
  `GDAL` that you're using.
- Added `#as_json`, `#to_json` to many classes.

### Changed

- Better handling of `CPLErr` return values.
- Split out additions to `GDAL/OGR` in `*_extensions.rb` modules.  Methods
  contained in `Extensions` modules don't directly wrap `GDAL`/`OGR` functions,
  but either provide new functionality or attempt to make library usage more
  Rubyesque.
- Lots of cleanup of class internals.
- `autoload` child `GDAL` and `OGR` Ruby classes.
- Renamed files under `ffi/` that were derived from `GDAL`/`OGR` header files to
  include `_h` in the name.

## [0.0.4] - 2014-09-27

### Fixed

- Fixed failure to load on Ubuntu 12.04 (GDAL v1.7.3).

## [0.0.3] - 2014-09-26

### Changed

- The `approx_ok` param for `RasterBand#histogram` should default to
  `false` (preferring data exactness over performance).

### Fixed

- Fixed URL silliness introduced in 0.0.2.
- `Dataset#*_band` methods should return `nil` if the band with that color
  isn't found.
- `RasterBand#default_histogram` died if the band didn't have any values.
- `RasterBand#histogram` wasn't returning totals.

## [0.0.2] - 2014-09-26

### Added

- Added ability to pass a URL into `GDAL::Dataset`.

## [0.0.1] - 2014-09-26

- Happy Birthday!
