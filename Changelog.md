## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `.release` class method for many `GDAL` types.
- Added `GDAL::Dataset.copy_whole_raster`.
- Added exception messages for `OGR` methods that raised using `OGR::ErrorHandling`.
- Added alias for `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::Exporters#to_gml` to `to_xml`.
- Wrapped `OGR_G_ExportToIsoWkt` and `OGR_G_ExportToJsonEx`.
- Added some `RBS` type definitions.

#### OGR

- Added `wkb` geometry types that have been added since GDAL 2.0. This includes
  [curve geometries](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc49_curve_geometries) and
  [measured geometries](https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc61_support_for_measured_geometries):
  - `OGR::CircularString`
  - `OGR::CompoundCurve`
  - `OGR::CurvePolygon`

### Changed

- _BREAKING_: All methods with default boolean args are now keyword args.
- _BREAKING_: `required_ruby_version` set to `>= 3.0`

#### GDAL

- _BREAKING_: `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value=` now accepts `nil` to allow unsetting the NODATA
  value.
- _BREAKING_: Many methods were not communicating errors `CPLErr` back to the caller; these now
  raise on `CE_Failure` or `CE_Fatal`:
  - `GDAL::Dataset#add_band`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#build_overviews`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#create_mask_band`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#geo_transform=`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#geo_transform`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#projection=`
  - `GDAL::Dataset#raster_io`
  - `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset_files`
  - `GDAL::Driver#delete_dataset`
  - `GDAL::Driver#rename_dataset`
  - `GDAL::MajorObject#set_metadata_item`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#create_column`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#set_linear_binning`
  - `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable.from_color_table`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#category_names=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#color_interpretation=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#color_table=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#compute_statistics=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#copy_whole_raster`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#create_mask_band`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#default_raster_attribute_table=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#fill`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#flush_cache`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#offset=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#scale=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#unit_type=`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`
  - `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`
- `GDAL` errors that return `CPLE_AppDefined` now raise `GDAL::Error`.
- `GDAL` errors now truncate less of the backtrace.
- `GDAL::RasterBand#scale` and `#offset` now return the `Float` value and raise on a failed call
  instead of returning a `Hash` with that info.

#### OGR

- _BREAKING_: `OGR::DataSource#copy_data_source` now raises instead of returning `nil` on a failure
  to copy.
- _BREAKING_: `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_utm`'s second param is
  now a keyword arg, `north:` that defaults to `true` (like GDAL's default).
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_towgs84`'s `z_distance` requires a
  value internally, but was defaulted to `nil`; changed the default value to `0.0`.
- _BREAKING_: `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#axis`'s `target_key` is
  now required.
- _BREAKING_: `OGR::CoordinateTransformation.new` raises a `GDAL:Error` instead of `OGR::Failure`.
  In GDAL 3, the GDAL error handler kicks in when bad data is used to instantiate the
  `CoordinateTranformation`. In < 3, the Ruby code checks the returned pointer and raises if it's
  null. Now these raise the same exception.
- _BREAKING_: `OGR::Driver.create_data_source` raises on failure instead of returning `nil`.
- _BREAKING_: Moved `OGR::Geometry#point_count` to `OGR::Geometry::XYPoints` and `XYZPoints`.
- _BREAKING_: Moved `OGR::Geometry#geometry_count` to `OGR::Geometry::Container`.
- _BREAKING_: Moved `OGR::Geometry::Container#polygon_from_edges` to
  `OGR::Geometry::PolygonFromEdges`.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::Importers` now return `self` instead of the `OGR` error code
  `Symbol`.
- Extracted methods from `OGR::GeometryTypes::Curve` and `OGR::GeometryTypes::Surface` to new
  `OGR::Geometry` mixins: `XYPoints`, `XYZPoints`, `Area`, `Length`.
- `OGR::Geometry` is now a (abstract) `class` from which other, concrete geometry objects inherit.

### Fixed

  - `OGR::Layer#name`
  - `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRSQLMethods#fid_column`
  - `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRSQLMethods#geometry_column`
  - `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#authority_code`
  - `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#authority_name`
  - `OGR::StyleTool#param_as_string`
  - `OGR::StyleTool#style_string`

### GDAL

- `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value` uses `BigDecimal` for checking the returned float value.

#### OGR

- [DEV-12827] Fixed a number of memory leaks where returned strings should be released using
  `FFI::CPL::VSI.VSIFree()`:
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_gml`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_kml`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_geo_json`
  - `OGR::Geometry#to_wkt`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_mapinfo`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_pci`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_proj4`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_usgs`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_wkt`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_pretty_wkt`
  - `OGR::SpatialReference#to_xml`
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::Importers::ClassMethods#new_from_epsga` was incorrectly calling
  `import_from_epsg` instead of `import_from_epsga`.
- `OGR::SpatialReference.release` fixed to use `OSRRelease()` in order to avoid use-after-free.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#set_utm`'s internal call was expecting
  an `int`, but was getting passed a `bool`.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#towgs84` now properly reads data out
  of the internal C array.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::CoordinateSystemGetterSetters#axis`: the `orientation` value in the
  returned `Hash` wasn't calling a fully qualified module.
- `OGR::SpatialReferenceMixins::Exporters#to_xml` now actually works.

### Removed

#### General

- [DEV-361] Move extension methods to ffi-gdal-extensions.
- Removed attach_function to CPLURLGetValue and CPLURLAddKVP as they are not in GDAL 2.
- `GDAL::MajorObject#description=`

#### OGR

- `OGR::GeometyTypes::Curve` and `OGR::GeometryTypes::Surface` removed; those used to be
  characteristics of some geometry types, but are their own types as of GDAL 2.1.

## [1.0.0.beta11] - 2020-06-02

### Fixed

- Change CPLFileFinder callback return type to pointer.

## [1.0.0.beta10] - 2019-08-28

### Fixed

- [DEV-7980] Ensure `OGR::Feature#field_as_string` returns a UTF-8 encoded String.

## [1.0.0.beta9] - 2018-03-26

### Fixed

- [AGDEV-30729] Change `OGERR_NONE` to use a lambda.

### Changed

- Fix some new rubocops.

## [1.0.0.beta8] - 2017-04-24

### Changed

- Ruby 2.3 frozen string compatibility.
- Ruby 2.4 `DateTime` time zone handling in `OGR::Feature#set_field_date_time`.

### Fixed

- Ensure `GDAL::RasterBandMixinsIOExtensions#read_blocks_by_block` always yields an Array of pixels.

## [1.0.0.beta7] - 2016-09-21

### Added

#### GDAL

- Added wrapper for GDALCreateAndReprojectImage in `gdal/dataset_mixins/warp_methods.rb`.
- Added `GDAL::Options.to_hash` to convert a pointer of options to a Ruby Hash.

### Changed

#### GDAL

- (BREAKING CHANGE) Additionally, changed `GDAL::DatasetMixins::WarpMethods#reproject_image`'s
  `destination_spatial_reference` named param to `destination_projection` which takes a String of
  WKT for a projection instead of an `OGR::SpatialReference`.
- Return `nil` for missing NODATA values in `GDAL::RasterBand#no_data_value` and `#no_data_value=`.

### Fixed

#### Core

- Fixed specifying an alternate GDAL library using the `GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH`.

#### GDAL

- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::IOExtensions#write_xy_narray` no longer duplicates data when blocks have
  a remainder.
- `GDAL::WarpOptions` should properly act as a wrapper for `FFI::GDAL::WarpOptions`.
- `Updated extract methods to be compatible with latest `GDAL::Driver#create_dataset`.
- `GDAL::MajorObject` now gets autoloaded.
- Fix `GDAL::DatasetMixins::AlgorithmMethods` to use the right `FFI` module for
  `#rasterize_geometries` and `#rasterize_layers`.

#### OGR

- [AGDEV-17357] Define constants from C using `const_set` instead of `class_eval`.
- Fixed `OGR::GeometryTypes::Curve#points` (missing local variable).

### Removed

- Removed all `#as_json` and `#to_json` definitions. They were out of date, not used, and sometimes
  confusing (ex `OGR::Geometries#to_json` vs `#to_geo_json`).

## [1.0.0.beta6] - 2016-04-18

### Added

#### GDAL

- Added wrappers for the Grid API. It uses `GDAL::Gridder`, which is the programmatic equivalent to
  the `gdal_grid` command-line utility, `GDAL::GridderOptions`, which is an object used to mimic the
  options you pass to `gdal_grid`, and `GDAL::Grid`, which is the simple object that performs the
  gridding.
- Added first wrapper of `gdalwarper.h` methods, found in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::WarpMethods`.
- Added `GDAL::GeoTransformMixins::Extensions.new_from_envelope` which lets you create a
  `GDAL::GeoTransform` using the points from an `OGR::Envelope` and the destination raster's width
  and height. It's convenient because it calculates the pixel size for you.
- Added `GDAL::RasterBand#write_block`. Somehow this went missing from previous `RasterBand`
  wrapping.
- Added `GDAL::InternalHelpers._buffer_from_data_type` to compliment the existing
  `._pointer_from_data_type`. Useful for creating buffer-specific pointers from a GDAL data type.
- Added `GDAL::InternalHelpers` methods for creating NArrays based on GDAL data types.
- `GDAL::Options` values all have `#to_s` called on them to ensure they're Strings before handing
  them over to GDAL. The GDAL options "hash" requires that both keys and values be Strings.
- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::AlgorithmMethods` that use GDALProgressFunc functions can now participate
  in GDALScaledProgress functions.
- Added `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Extensions#pixel_count`.
- Allow `GDAL::Dataset`s to be open in shared mode vs non-shared mode. All Datasets now default to
  use shared mode.
- Added enumerator `RasterAttributeTableMixins::Extensions#each_column` to allow nicer iterating
  over columns.

#### OGR

- Added `OGR::CoordinateTransform#transform_ex`.
- Added `OGR::FeatureExtensions#field()` which gets the field using the associated
  `OGR::FieldDefinition#type`. Makes so you don't always have to request the field by its type
  (`field_as_double`).
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#point_values()` which gets values for all of the points in the
  layer. It also allows you to specify getting field values with that, which helps retrieving data
  for the Grid API. You can also pass it a block to filter out points that don't match some criteria
  defined in the block.
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#any_geometries_with_z?` which simply checks to see if the
  layer has any geometries with Z values.
- `GDAL::DataType.by_name` always calls `#to_s` on the param now, letting you pass in Symbols.
- Added `OGR::Point#set_point`, `OGR::Point25#set_point`, and `OGR::GeometryTypes::Curve#set_point`
  wrappers for `OGR_G_SetPoint_2D` and `OGR_G_SetPoint`.
- Added `OGR::LineString#add_geometry` to allow adding a OGR::Point object to the LineString instead
  of having to pass coordinates in to #add_point.
- Added `OGR::GeometryMixins::Extensions#invalid?` to compliment `OGR::Geometry#valid?`.
- Added `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#point_geometry`, `#each_point_geometry`, and
  `point_geometries`. Since `#point` implies it returns a Point object, but the OGR API's related
  method returns point values (x, y, z), it seemed like it would be useful to have a method that
  returned a geometry.

### Changed

#### GDAL

- Renamed `GDAL::GridTypes` to `GDAL::GridAlgorithms`. This shouldn't impact anyone/thing since it's
  only relative to the newly added Grid API wrapper. There just happened to me some Grid cruft that
  had been laying around for some time.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Extenions#each_by_block` to `#read_by_block`. Its functionality
  was doing reading, yet implied reading or writing; since writing by block isn't needed anywhere
  internally yet, I just renamed this.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterBandMixins#write_array` to `#write_xy_narray`. This method's name inferred
  that it could write any old Array, but that's not the case--it only writes 2D NArray data.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#extent` now manually builds an `OGR::Polygon` instead of
  polygonizing the entire dataset and taking the envelope of that. Much faster this way.
- Refactored `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::Exsentions#projected_points` to return a 3D NArray (indicating
  pixel/row position) instead of just a 2D NArray of coordinates.
- Allow `GDAL::RasterBand#create_mask_band` to take a single flag or many.
- Allow `GDAL::Driver#create_dataset` and `GDAL::Dataset.open` to take a block, yielding the dataset
  then closing it afterwards.
- `GDAL::RasterBandClassifier` now uses NArray to classify. Can result in quite a large performance
  gain.
- `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable` methods that returned -1 when a value can't be returned now return
  nil instead.
- Renamed `GDAL::RasterAttributeTable#value_to_*` methods to be named after their C functions. Also,
  renamed `#add_value` to `#set_value` and refactored into `RasterAttributeTableMixins::Extensions`.
- Swapped order of params in `GDAL::Driver#rename_dataset` to be (old, new) instead of (new, old).
- `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset` now yields a writable Dataset.
- `GDAL::Driver#copy_dataset` now properly takes progress block arguments.

#### OGR

- `OGR::DataSource.open` can now take a block, yielding the data source, then closing it afterwards.
- Extracted `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#each_feature` from `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#features`
  to provide an Enumerator. This lets consumers utilize yielded `OGR::Feature`s as they're retrieved
  instead of after the `features` Array has been built. `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#features` now
  uses this too.

### Fixed

- Cleanup `OGR::Feature`s that were a result of `OGR::Layer#next_feature`. According to GDAL docs,
  these _must_ be cleaned up before the layer is.

#### GDAL

- `GDAL::RasterBandMixins::AlgorithmMethods#fill_nodata!` was calling the old name of the C
  function.
- `GDAL::EnvironmentMethods#dump_open_datasets` now works.

#### OGR

- `OGR::Field#date=` was casting the passed value to a `Time` object, which in doing so was setting
  the time zone. If a user passes in an object that doesn't have the TZ set, the method shouldn't be
  setting it for them.
- `OGR::Geometry#point_on_surface` now properly returns a geometry object.
- `OGR::CoordinateTransform#transform` never worked. Fixed.
- `OGR::GeometryMixins::Extensions#utm_zone` no longer creates invalid geometry.
- `OGR::Feature#dump_readable` never worked. Fixed.
- `OGR::Geometry#dump_readable` never worked. Fixed.
- Added missing output_layer param to `OGR::LayerMixins::OGRLayerMethodMethods`.
- `FFI::OGR::Core::WKBGeometryType` was using an INT32 instead of UINT32 and thus 25D geometry types
  weren't completely accurate.
- `OGR::LayerMixins::Extensions#geometry_from_extent` now builds an `OGR::Polygon` using the same
  algorithm that `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#extent` uses. One could argue that there was also
  a bug here in that `geometry_from_extent` used to return the convex hull of the extent, not the
  extent itself.

### Removed

- Removed all `ObjectSpace.define_finalizer` calls that "cleaned up" C pointers for Ruby-wrapped
  objects that had not yet been closed/destroyed. This was keeping those Ruby objects from getting
  collected (?) and effectively causing lots of unnecessary memory use.

## [1.0.0.beta5] - 2015-06-16

### Added

- Added `GDAL::RasterBand#raster_io` and refactored `GDAL::RasterBand#write_array` to use it.

### Changed

- `GDAL::RasterBandClassifier#equal_count_ranges` now returns `nil` if there aren't enough points
  per group/class to return the requested number of breaks.
- Simplified NDVI (and related) methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions`.
- NDVI and related methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` now close the newly created dataset
  instead of leaving it open. It's been far too easy to forget to close the dataset after creation,
  leaving seemingly incorrect resulting datasets (since GDAL doesn't flush writes until the dataset
  is closed).
- NDVI methods in `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` no longer check for NaNs after doing the NDVI
  calculations, thus speeding up the algorithm.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions#remove_negatives_from` now uses an NArray mask to remove the
  negative values instead of looping through each value.
- `GDAL::DatasetMixins::Extensions` NDVI methods now default to NODATA of `-9999.0`.

## [1.0.0.beta4] - 2015-04-22

Whoa there's lots of changes here... Many are outlined below, but there's really a ton more.

### Added

- Added `GDAL::RasterClassifier` for classifying raster bands.
- Added some wrapper methods for classes that support capability testing.
- Better library finding on Linux.
- Wrapped most of `GDAL`'s Grid API.
- Wrapped some of `GDAL`'s Warp API.
- `GDAL::Dataset` can now open PostGISRaster datasets.

### Changed

- Full refactor of FFI/C function wrapper. Closer mapping of Ruby functions within modules to the
  C-header files where the functions actually reside.
- Full redesign of the error handling mechanism; ffi-gdal now hooks in to GDAL's error handling,
  thus errors raised from GDAL automagically get handed over as Ruby exceptions. (GDAL only; OGR
  doesn't provide this.) This also entailed adding a bunch of new exceptions and renaming some old
  ones.
- Lots more `OGR` love. Much of this API has now been vetted.

### Fixed

- Fixed some `GDAL::Dataset` extension methods (`extract_ndvi` and friends) that weren't properly
  handling various data types.
- Better handling of large files.
- Fixed regular crashes when dealing with `OGR` Geometries and `SpatialReferences`.

## [1.0.0.beta3] - 2014-11-11

### Fixed

- `ogr/exceptions` wasn't being required for `ext/error_symbols.rb`, thus any use of an OGR
  exception was causing a `NameError`.

## [1.0.0.beta2] - 2014-10-23

### Added

- Added more documentation
- Uncommented `attach_function` calls that had been commented out due to lack of support in versions
  I'd tested on. These get handled now on load.

## [1.0.0.beta1] - 2014-10-23

Lots of changes, so just the highlights here...

### Added

- Added C and Ruby wrapper for most of `OGR`.
- Allow loading, even when C functions aren't defined in the version of `GDAL` that you're using.
- Added `#as_json`, `#to_json` to many classes.

### Changed

- Better handling of `CPLErr` return values.
- Split out additions to `GDAL/OGR` in `*_extensions.rb` modules. Methods contained in `Extensions`
  modules don't directly wrap `GDAL`/`OGR` functions, but either provide new functionality or
  attempt to make library usage more Rubyesque.
- Lots of cleanup of class internals.
- `autoload` child `GDAL` and `OGR` Ruby classes.
- Renamed files under `ffi/` that were derived from `GDAL`/`OGR` header files to include `_h` in the
  name.

## [0.0.4] - 2014-09-27

### Fixed

- Fixed failure to load on Ubuntu 12.04 (GDAL v1.7.3).

## [0.0.3] - 2014-09-26

### Changed

- The `approx_ok` param for `RasterBand#histogram` should default to `false` (preferring data
  exactness over performance).

### Fixed

- Fixed URL silliness introduced in 0.0.2.
- `Dataset#*_band` methods should return `nil` if the band with that color isn't found.
- `RasterBand#default_histogram` died if the band didn't have any values.
- `RasterBand#histogram` wasn't returning totals.

## [0.0.2] - 2014-09-26

### Added

- Added ability to pass a URL into `GDAL::Dataset`.

## [0.0.1] - 2014-09-26

- Happy Birthday!
