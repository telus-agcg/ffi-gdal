# ffi-gdal

Ruby wrapper around GDAL, using FFI, along with some helper methods.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ffi-gdal'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ffi-gdal

Note that this requires you to have `libgdal` installed on your system and
accessible in your `PATH`.

## Usage

ffi-gdal provides two interfaces, really: the direct FFI wrapper around GDAL's C
API, and a Ruby-fied interface that uses the FFI wrapper to make use more like
using an object-oriented library instead of a functional one. Most likely you'll
just want to use the Ruby-fied library, but if for some reason that doesn't get
you what you want, direct access to the FFI wrapper (which is really just direct
access to the C API) is available.

### The Ruby-fied Library

To distinguish this gem from the already-existing gdal gem, you
`require ffi-gdal` to get access to the `GDAL` module and its children.

### The direct FFI wrapper

Following RubyGem conventions, to get access to the FFI wrapper, you
`require ffi/gdal`.

### Logging

For classes that are enabled with logging capabilities, you can turn logging on
and off like `GDAL::RasterBand.logging_enabled = true`. If you're using ffi-gdal
in Rails, you can `GDAL::Logger.logger = Rails.logger`.

### Debugging

Additional error logging can be enabled through GDAL's [global configuration options](https://gdal.org/user/configoptions.html).

```ruby
FFI::CPL::Conv.CPLSetConfigOption('CPL_DEBUG', 'ON')
FFI::CPL::Conv.CPLSetConfigOption('CPL_LOG_ERRORS', 'ON')
```

### Docker

There are a couple `Dockerfile`s that allow doing development/testing against
GDAL 2.4 and 3.x.

...for GDAL2:

```sh
docker-compose run gdal2 bundle exec rake spec
```

...for GDAL3:

```sh
docker-compose run gdal3 bundle exec rake spec
```
